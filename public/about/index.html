                <h3>What is this?</h3>
                <p>
                    This api is a server with a database that keeps track of user sleep data
                    as provided through the <a href ="https://sleep-tracker-app-d6kq.onrender.com/" target = "_blank">Sleep Tracker App</a>. The app will 
                    take the times when you go to sleep, wake up and your mood before and after sleep
                    including your mood during the day. This will provide recommendation on how long
                    you should sleep for in order to be at your best during the day.

                <h3>What is an API?</h3>
                <p>
                    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a contract that allow developers to interact 
                    with an application through a set of interfaces. In this case, the application is a database 
                    of sleep tracking data, and the interfaces are URL links.
                    <br />
                    A RESTful API is an API that conforms to a set of loose conventions based on HTTP verbs, 
                    errors, and hyperlinks.

                <h3>Why was this created?</h3>
                <p>
                    This API was created as a Build Week Project for Lambda School. A Build week is 
                    a period of 1 week for full time students, and 2 weeks for part time students where 
                    they are grouped together in teams consisting of a UI Web Developers, React Frontend
                    Developers, and Backend Developers. Each section of the team can have 1 or more members.

                <h3>What information is stored here?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our sleep tracker database only takes your first and last name, an email and a password. 
                    Each sleep entry just take the date and times for your sleep cycles and your mood.
